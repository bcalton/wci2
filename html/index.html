         <h2>How to use the WCI Portal</h2>
         <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
            <h4>It's still in development</h4>
            <p>It's important to remember that this version is an early version and still in development. You will discover things that do not work properly or behave in a different way to the way you expected. Please bear this in mind</p>
         </div>
         
         <h4>The right browser</h4>
         <p>The WCI portal has been built to take advantage of the capabilities of modern browsers so you will need the latest version of Firefox or Chrome, or versions 9, 10 or 11 of Internet Explorer. You will also need to have <b>Javascript enabled</b></p>
         
         <h4>Creating a map</h4>
         <p><b>Select some indicators</b> - when the portal first loads you will see a layer showing the base map overlayed with country borders. The panel on the left of the screen enables you to select indicators that are of interest by clicking on the icon to the right of the indicator name (looks like an eye). A list of popular indicators is displayed first, however, you can select from drop down lists of indicators grouped by type of by data source. Click on the 'Search' tab to find an indicator using the name or part of the name.</p>
         <p><b>Build a map</b> - once you have selected the required indicators, click the 'Build a Map' button to view further information about the indicators you have selected.</p>
         <p><b>Navigate</b> - there will be a set of buttons that allows you to navigate around the map and to zoom in and out, however, for now you will have to use your mouse. Click and hold the left mouse button to drag the map around and use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.</p>
         <p><b>Analyse</b> - in a future release you will be able to select a bounding box for an area of interest and create a timeseries plot for the selected indicators, or export these data for external processing. You will find that controls exist for these features, however, at present they are not functioning.</p>

         <h2>Development &amp; Feedback</h2>
         <p>Milestone 3 of the eartH2Observe project is set for June 2014 and this requires the first version of the data portal to be available online. The portal development will continue throughout the duration of the project; milestone 8 in September 2015 marks the halfway point, and deliverable D7.9 in November 2017 is the completed version of the portal.</p>
         <p>With each release of the portal a list of enhancements made and bugs fixed will be published here so that all parties can see progress as it unfolds.</p>
         <p><b>Ideas and Feedback</b> - if you have ideas for how the portal should operate we would really like to hear them. In fact, the sooner you are able to offer feedback on existing functionality and/or suggest ideas for enhancements the greater the chance of them being included. If you come up with a fantastic idea in October 2017 there won't a lot of time to develop it. </p>
         <p>Please send your ideas/suggestions/feedback/(complaints) to <a href="mailto:bac@pml.ac.uk">Ben Calton</a> at PML</p>

         <h2>Data Services</h2>
         <p>EartH2Observe is working to integrate available earth observations, in-situ datasets and models, in order to construct a consistent global water resources reanalysis. The resulting and intermediate datasets will be made available here through a variety of methods:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The Water Cycle Integrator data portal</li>
            <li>Open and freely accessible data services - OPeNDAP, WMS and WCS available using THREDDS Data Server: <a href="http://wci.earth2observe.eu/thredds" target="_blank">http://wci.earth2observe.eu/thredds</a></li>
            <li>A data exchange (primarily for internal project use)
               <ul>
                  <li>FTP server: wci.earth2observe.eu</li>

         <h2>About the Portal</h2>
         <p>The WCI portal is an open source project built by Plymouth Marine Laboratory's Remote Sensing Group. The portal builds on the development of several other EU funded projects, past and present, that PML have involvement in. You can find the code on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/earth2observe-pml/GISportal">https://github.com/earth2observe-pml/GISportal</a></p>
         <p>The frontend views is HTML and Javascript and uses OpenLayers to display map layers produced by THREDDS, an OGC standards Web Map Service. There is a middleware section written in Python that accepts AJAX requests initiated by the user/browser and transforms these requests into WMS and WCS requests.</p>
